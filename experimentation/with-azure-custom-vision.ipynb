    "**Contributor:** *Robiu Olalere / Algebra101*  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview  \n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a **food image classifier** using **Azure Custom Vision** and a **Kaggle dataset of Nigerian foods**.  \n",
    "The objective was to automate dataset upload, train a multiclass classifier, and expose prediction endpoints for local inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset  \n",
    "- **Source:** [Nigeria Food AI Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elinteerie/nigeria-food-ai-dataset)  \n",
    "- The dataset is stored in a **binary format**, so it must be **extracted** before Azure Custom Vision recognizes the images.  \n",
    "- There is noticeable **class imbalance**, which slightly reduced recall for underrepresented classes.  \n",
    "- Example: foods with fewer samples showed recall below 50%, while classes with more samples achieved higher precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Upload  \n",
    "A custom uploader script was implemented to handle robust dataset uploading:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handles extraction from KaggleHub cache.  \n",
    "- Uploads images in **batches of 64** (Azureâ€™s upload limit).  \n",
    "- Supports **automatic resume** after network interruptions using a local progress checkpoint file.  \n",
    "- Total upload time: **â‰ˆ 29 minutes 30 seconds**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training  \n",
    "- **Project type:** Classification (Multiclass)  \n",
