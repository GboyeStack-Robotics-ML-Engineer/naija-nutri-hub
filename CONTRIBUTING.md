# Contributing to the Hacktoberfest Repository

Welcome to the **Naija Nutri Hub** project repository for ML/AI Engineering and Backend, organized by the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors and GitHub Campus Experts, Unilag for Hacktoberfest 2025! We're excited to have you contribute and improve this innovative project.

## How to Install Dependencies and Work on the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   From your terminal, clone your forked repository and name it `naija-nutri-hub`.

   ```bash
   # Replace {user_name} with your GitHub username
   git clone https://github.com/{user_name}/naija-nutri-hub.git
   ```

2. **Create a Branch for Your Contribution:**

   Before making any changes, create a new branch. This keeps the `main` branch clean and makes it easier to review contributions.
   Use a descriptive name for your branch based on the type of contribution:
   ```bash
   # General format
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```
   **Examples:**
   For documentation updates:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b docs/update-contributing
   ```
   For a new feature:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/recipe-api
   ```
   For a bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/login-bug
   ```

3. **Set Up Virtual Environment:**

   Create a virtual environment named `naija-nutri-hub`.

   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv naija-nutri-hub

   # macOS or Linux
   python3 -m venv naija-nutri-hub
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   # Windows
   naija-nutri-hub\Scripts\activate

   # macOS or Linux
   source naija-nutri-hub/bin/activate
   ```

   Install necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd naija-nutri-hub
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Add the virtual environment to Jupyter Kernel if necessary:

   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=naija-nutri-hub
   ```
   
4. **Work on the Project:**

   - This repository is specifically for the **Naija Nutri Hub** project (ML/AI Engineering + Backend). Explore the project structure and check the **Issues** tab for tasks or bugs that you can address. 
   - You are encouraged to review the current implementation and contribute new features or improvements.

5. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**

   Once your contributions are ready, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "{COMMIT_MESSAGE}"
   git push
   ```

6. **Submit a Pull Request:**

   After pushing your changes, submit a pull request to merge them into the main repository. Make sure to include a clear and concise description of what your contribution entails.
